### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­  I work in the field of computational particle and collider physics. My work includes numerical and analytical modeling, analyzing large datasets, visualizing the data, and utilizing statistical techniques to understand collider problems. Currently, I am working on the partonic and spin structure of hadrons, phenomenology for semi-inclusive/exclusive electron scattering, and the properties of hot/dense strongly interacting nuclear matter.
