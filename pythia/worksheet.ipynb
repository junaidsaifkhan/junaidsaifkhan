        "The Pythia 8.3 program is a standard tool for the generation of high-energy collisions (specifically, it focuses on centre-of-mass energies greater than about 10 GeV), comprising a coherent set of physics models for the evolution from a few-body high-energy (\"hard\") scattering process to a complex multihadronic final state. The particles are produced in vacuum. Simulation of the interaction of the produced particles with detector material is not included in Pythia but can, if needed, be done by interfacing to external detector-simulation codes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Pythia 8.3 code package contains a library of hard interactions and models for initial- and final-state parton showers, multiple parton-parton interactions, beam remnants, string fragmentation and particle decays. It also has a set of utilities and interfaces to external programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective of this exercise is to teach you the basics of how to use the Pythia 8.3 event generator to study various physics aspects. As you become more familiar you will better understand the tools at your disposal, and can develop your own style to use them. Within this first exercise it is not possible to describe the physics models used in the program; for this we refer to the [Pythia 8.3 manual](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11601), and to all the further references found in them. For practical usage, the [Pythia 8.3 HTML manual](https://pythia.org/latest-manual/Welcome.html) provides full documentation on running and configuring Pythia. A [Pythia 8.3 Doxygen manual](https://pythia.org/latest-doxygen) is also available, although the HTML manual should always be used as the primary documentation."

        "Pythia 8 is, by today's standards, a small package. It is completely self-contained, and is therefore easy to install for standalone usage, e.g. if you want to have it on your own laptop, or if you want to explore physics or debug code without any danger of destructive interference between different libraries. This worksheet uses Pythia's Python interface, using an installation included in the Docker container. If you would like to run Pythia 8.3 natively using `C++`, please take a look at the analogous [standalone worksheet](https://pythia.org/download/pdf/worksheet8200.pdf), which includes installation instructions. You can download the latest version at [pythia.org](https://pythia.org/).\n",

        "When you use Pythia you are expected to write the main program yourself, for maximal flexibility and power. Several examples of such main programs are included with the code, to illustrate common tasks and help getting started. The section [A Hello World Program](#scrollTo=A_Hello_World_Program) gives you a simple step-by-step recipe how to write a minimal main program, that can then gradually be expanded in different directions, e.g. as in [A first realistic analysis](#scrollTo=A_first_realistic_analysis).\n",

        "In the section [Input files](#scrollTo=Input_files) you will see how the parameters of a run can be read in from a file, so that the main program can be kept fixed.

For Python usage, this is not an issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final three sections provide suggestions for optional further studies, and can be addressed in any order. [CKKW-L merging](#scrollTo=CKKW-L_merging) deals with the important topic of merging of external matrix-element input of different orders, introducing the CKKW-L scheme as a suitable starting point. [Some studies of Higgs production](#scrollTo=Some_studies_of_Higgs_production) describes how you can explore various physics aspects of the Standard Model Higgs production and decay.

        "An important part of the event record is that many copies of the same particle may exist, but only those with a positive status code are still present in the final state. To exemplify, consider a top quark produced in the hard interaction, initially with positive status code. When later a shower branching $\\t \\to \\t \\g$ occurs, the new $\\t$ and $\\g$ are added at the bottom of the then-current event record, but the old $\\t$ is not removed. It is marked as decayed, however, by negating its status code. At any stage of the shower there is thus only one \"current\" copy of the top. After the shower, when the final top decays, $\\t \\to \\b \\W^+$, also that copy receives a negative status code. When you understand the basic principles, see if you can find several copies of the top quarks, and check the status codes to figure out why each new copy has been added. Also note how the mother/daughter indices tie together the various copies."

        "The main programs we have constructed and studied in the previous sections have one common drawback: all start from the Pythia 8 internal library of lowest-order processes, and then add higher-order corrections entirely by the internal parton-shower machinery. This will give reliable results for soft and collinear configurations, but less so for  multiple hard, well-separated jets. To model the latter similarly well, we need to include external input from higher-order calculations at tree level and, where feasible, at one-loop level. A number of different external programs can provide such input, using the LHA/LHEF standard format to transfer information, usually as LHE files (see [Generic User Process Interface for Event Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0109068), [A standard format for Les Houches Event Files](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0609017), and [Les Houches 2013: Physics at TeV Colliders: Standard Model Working Group Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1067)). The hard-process events stored in these files will be accepted or rejected in such a way that  doublecounting between different parton multiplicities is removed, resulting in a smooth transition between the multiplicities, and between the external input and the internal handling of parton showers. These two tasks usually go hand in hand.\n",
